0,1hdvorw,Maximizing My Bitcoin Holdings with The BGBTC ,"After staking our bitcoin cash what other use case can we really rely on for the future and seems like i kinda foind something useful, not sure yet though. 

As Bitcoin's bull run continues, I'm exploring ways to leverage my holdings more effectively. The Bitget BGBTC event has caught my attention due to its potential benefits for those of us interested in both holding and actively engaging with our crypto assets.  
The event offers:

* Staking Rewards: Consistent rewards which could enhance the yield on Bitcoin holdings.
* BGPoints: Points that might be valuable for future airdrops or other benefits.
* BTC as Collateral: An opportunity to explore futures trading by using Bitcoin as collateral, thus diversifying investment strategies without selling off Bitcoin.

I'm curious about how others are planning to utilize this event to optimize their Bitcoin strategy. The event ends on January 8, 2025, so there's still time to consider participation.   
  
What are your thoughts on using such events to enhance your Bitcoin holdings? Have you found other strategies effective during this bull run?

1,1hckkp4,"Build, Learn, Earn with Strong HoldCoin Community for Shared Growth","HoldCoin stands out as a unique Telegram-based crypto asset management simulator game, where the ethos goes beyond mere competition to foster friendship, community, and shared growth. Within this game, players have the opportunity to HOLD various crypto assets, constructing a portfolio that enables them to earn coins through passive income.   
  
The core mechanic is straightforward: the more coins players hold, the greater their passive income, encouraging a strategy of asset accumulation and diversification.  
Having attracted over 9 million Web3 users, HoldCoin has not only maintained its appeal within this demographic but has also successfully drawn in a significant number of Web2 users, expanding its reach and influence. This blend of communities has led to an enriching environment where players not only enjoy the game but also gain practical knowledge about managing digital assets.   
  
Through in-game activities like quests and on-chain operations, participants have developed their own Web3 resident IDs, alongside acquiring valuable skills and knowledge.  
Platforms like Bitget are tapping into the excitement around HoldCoin by offering incentives such as additional $HOLD for users who engage in specific actions, like depositing HOLDCOIN or locking BTC for an airdrop. These incentives can be particularly alluring in the context of a bull run, where the promise of quick returns is tantalizing.   
  
However, while these opportunities cater to short-term profit motives, it's equally important for investors to consider the long-term value and sustainability of projects like HoldCoin.  
The crypto space is rife with examples like memecoins, which can see meteoric rises due to viral trends on social media but come with significant risks due to their volatility. In contrast, HoldCoin's approach focuses on education and community building, offering a more stable foundation for both new entrants into the crypto world and seasoned investors looking for projects with real utility.   
  
The transition from Web2 to Web3 that HoldCoin facilitates is not just about earning potential but also about learning and community engagement. As players continue to grow their portfolios, they also enhance their understanding of blockchain technology, making HoldCoin a noteworthy project in the broader crypto ecosystem. This dual focus on immediate engagement and long-term education positions HoldCoin uniquely in a market often dominated by short-term speculation.

2,1hcfdms,BGBTC staking looks like the future for staking ,"Looks like i found something interesting that has not beem rampant out there it's mainlly for BTC holders to have a nice time staking.   
  
BGBTC introduces a suite of innovative features designed to maximize the potential of your Bitcoin holdings. With effortless staking, you can stake your BTC and enjoy consistent returns while simultaneously earning BGPoints. These points can later be redeemed for token airdrops from a variety of projects, adding an extra layer of benefit to your investment.  
  
The concept of multiple earning opportunities is central to BGBTC, where your Bitcoin not only appreciates in value over time but also participates in token airdrops through strategic partnerships within the BTCFi ecosystem. This essentially turns your Bitcoin into a dynamic income generator, offering avenues for both passive and active income.  
  
An early settlement option provides additional flexibility; you can choose to settle your BGPoints earnings early, based on current market rates, providing liquidity when needed without waiting for the staking period to end.  
  
BGBTC also supports flexible trading and earn scenarios, where it can be used in diverse trading environments. Whether it's as collateral for loans or margin in futures trading, BGBTC allows you to diversify your investment strategies, making your Bitcoin work harder for you.  
  
The token's role in ecosystem growth cannot be overstated. By holding BGBTC, you're not just investing in Bitcoin; you're gaining access to participate in Launchpool and PoolX opportunities from various BTCFi projects, directly benefiting from the growth and innovations within this ecosystem.  
  
Finally, enhanced security with dual custody underpins the safety of your investment. BGBTC is secured by both Bitget and Cobo, using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets with multi-signature technology. This ensures that your assets are protected with no single point of failure, as no single party can alter or move your transactions unilaterally, offering peace of mind in your investment journey.

11,1hg1pel,Cold Feet,"It's a major deal for me to put 1k into anything, and I'm concerned about short term drop. I know anything goes for Bitcoin, but it's taken me this long to buy in. I remember when it dropped from $20 to $6 per BTC in 2011, my friend told me ""it's the future"". To be honest, I was only 16 and it was so shady back then it felt risky to buy. I don't even know if there were ""wallets"", I can't even remember how they were stored.

Anyhow, this is for the future. I don't need any more convincing, after seeing 10 years and over 16000% growth on what could have been. 

Am I actually too late this time? If I'm aggressive and can get 10k in over the next couple years, is there a chance I could cash out near 100k and pay off what's left of my mortgage? 

I don't want to get rich, I just want to live comfortably without these massive bills over my head. If I'm being honest, my wife isn't thoroughly convinced, so I'd be doing this in less than ideal circumstances. Essentially, I'm having to be duplicitous in hopes of having a better future for my family, because I think it's my best shot. I'm adding this for context so frivolous advice is discouraged; I'm betting a lot.

Any thoughts out there? What are the realistic prospects for a 1mil BTC in the next decade? I think it's possible it could become a (probably not THE) standard universal currency one day.

Am I just trying to recooperate my massive losses and it's too late? Or is a 10x increase written on the wall?

12,1hfvvd0,Genuine question: are we close to the cycle top? ,"Many Alts have had some sort of correction ranging between 30-50%, and BTC itself hasn’t had a significant correction yet in recent months, although it’s been making new ATH almost every week (though smaller gains).

It seems the recent rally can be tied to the US elections and Trump being pro-crypto and rumors of a BTC reserve. Would this be a buy the rumor & sell the news type of thing? Does Trumps inauguration signal the top for this bull run? 

Along with this, recent MSTR tweets about their BTC accumulation and trying to convince Microsoft just doesn’t feel right… like as if there is way too much hype in the right now with everyone screaming about BTC going over $100k. The overall crypto market cap has already gone over 35% compared to last bull run. This is crazy especially during times of worldwide conflict and post covid recovery.

I’ve got a portfolio mix of 70% BTC , 15% LTC and 15% Algo. Clearly all the Alts have had a similar trend of corrections.

In dollar terms, I’m making solid gains, but in Bitcoin terms, my portfolio is bleeding.

48% Bitcoin

24% Ethereum (ETH)

23% Solana (SOL)

That said, the recent BTC pumps sting. Next time, I’m leaning toward going all-in on Bitcoin and just chilling—I’m getting too old for this high-risk game.

Perhaps even the four year cycle that we've come to expect will fall apart soon.

The thing is all of us are waiting for 2026 or so for the next bear market, and we all are going to buy in then. However, how disappointed would we be if (lets assume this round BTC peaks at 140K) BTC actually bottomed out at 90K or something, and then in the next run it just made it to 180K in 2028. Or, for example, lets say that ETH peaks at 6K, then bottoms out at 4K, and makes it to 8K in 2028. Those scenarios would likely be disappointing to many on here, but I see this type of thing is pretty realistic.

At a certain point, is it not true that this whole thing will not be happening? After all, if cryptocurrency indeed does become a major currency, its value will be pretty stable. None of this stuff will matter anymore. How far is that though?

16,1hfk86p,When to sell? Pt 1,"Hello crypto friends! This is the first part in a series of posts about when to sell. Originally I wrote this for my friends in the Hegecoin community. But this info is useful no matter what coin you're into. So in the spirit of the season, I'm gonna share it with all of you in here too. Hope you like it and happy holidays from Hege!

In this initial post I'll first cover some basics and outline a strategy. Then I'll dive into the first part of the strategy by explaining the four year crypto cycle and how to view it through the bitcoin dominance chart.

So let's dive in.

As I said, I want to share some thoughts with you all about when to sell. Now is certainly not the time! But let's be real, at the end of the day we're all here to make money. And, Dell jokes aside, this means at some point in time we will have to sell.

But when is that time? When DO we Dell?

The unfortunate truth here is this: nobody knows exactly. And anybody who tells you otherwise, that they can predict the top in advance, well they're either delusional, or they're simply lying to you.

The second unfortunate truth is that you will not be able to play this perfectly. You are not going to get lucky enough to sell at the exact top. But. The good news is that your timing doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be good enough. And with the help of some key charts, I think good enough is totally possible to achieve for all of us.

But what charts should we keep track of? And how should we interpret them? There are hundreds of different ones to consider, and no single one is going to give us the absolute truth. In my opinion we should select a few key charts and principles and stick to those. Otherwise, we will always be able to find that one chart that confirms whatever it is that we already believe, and we'll end up fooling ourselves. (Confirmation bias is a bitch!)

So with that in mind, I have selected three things to consider:

1. **Crypto market cycle dynamics**, to get the big picture view.

2. **Moving averages**, to spot long term trend changes.

3. **Classical chart patterns**, to give early warning signs.

I can't possibly cover all of these in one post. So I will split this across a series of at least three posts. In this first one I will start to cover point number one: **crypto market cycles**.

I'm sure most of you are already aware of the four year crypto cycle theory. Basically it says that bitcoin and the crypto market tops every four years. The past three tops have been in 2013, 2017, and 2021, respectively. If this pattern keeps repeating, it will top again sometime in the coming 6-12 months.

Before 2013, we actually had a significant top in 2011 as well, so the track record is not perfect. But it is still good enough that we should pay close attention. However, instead of just looking at the time component, which is difficult to predict, I think a better way to see what is going on in these cycles is to study the so called dominance charts. I have selected two of them: bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), and others dominance (OTHERS.D).

Let's start with the bitcoin dominance chart. It simply shows us how much of the entire crypto market cap that belongs to bitcoin. At the time of writing, the entire crypto market cap is around $3.5 trillion, and bitcoin is around $2 trillion. So this gives us a bitcoin dominance of around 2/3.5 = 56.5%. In other words, bitcoin makes up about 56.5% of the entire crypto market right now.

What we want to study here is how this dominance has changed within the past cycles. And when we do that, we see that it follows a clear pattern: it tops out shortly before the cycle tops, and then it falls sharply leading into the peak. This nosedive into the end of the cycle represents the mythical alt season, where altcoins go on gravity-defying mind-melting rallies.

[BTC dominance \(BTC.D\) from 2017 to 2024.](https://preview.redd.it/8ptvlql6z77e1.png?width=4914&format=png&auto=webp&s=30da4863265b369fba062c02b8a16d8930f7220e)

Looking at the present chart, we see that the bitcoin dominance clearly has started to topple over recently. But we also see that it still has a long way down to go. This means two things:

1. It is very unlikely that the cycle top is in.

2. Alt season is only just starting.

So, judging by this chart, there is nothing to be concerned about right now. It is not yet time to sell.

But. When this chart starts showing bitcoin dominance down in the 40% area, that will be a warning sign that the top is near. This is the important message here. So friends, pay attention to this chart going forward!

We cannot go by the bitcoin dominance chart alone, but it is key to understand what is going on. So make sure you understand it completely. In the next post we’ll have a look at the others dominance, which is a useful mirror image of the bitcoin dominance. So stay tuned for that!

A while back, I noticed that there's a gap manual and algorithmic trading - for lack of a better term, I'll just call products pertaining to this gap ""assisted trading"": it's not really algorithmic, but it's not manual trading either.

  
And this is exactly what this tool does - it uses an LLM under the hood, that's connected to my cryptocurrency exchange using methods that execute specific actions such as:

* Checking my portfolio
* Placing trades on my behalf
* Reporting on trade performance
* plotting charts

The interface is a simple text field where you type your request in, and the chat history lives on top. Here is an example of my asking it to buy $15 worth of Polygon:

https://preview.redd.it/8jpnju3yj07e1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02d4087935cf0b878897c49574205b282b3bb670

It's job is to basically simplify and optimise the process of interacting with a cryptocurrency exchange. For instance, consider the following flow:

\- Log into exchange, navigate to pair, hit trade, select your amount, place a market order

vs

\- start CryptoGPT - ask it to buy you x amount of coin.

  
The flow could become even more efficient if I gave it the functionality to top up my crypto account with fiat from my bank account but I didn't feel like indulging into my AI findom kink that day.

  
Same idea of efficiency around other requests too - I can simply ask to see my recent trades instead of having to go look for them.

https://preview.redd.it/cwgc0iswk07e1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd48b014acce9e4bba21fe84fbb76b4a69e02bdf

In the future I'm planning to add support to perform actions between exchanges such as: Transfer $50 of Bitcoin from Coinbase to Binance, or send 69.420 DOGE to my friend (theoretical example if I had friends).

I made a video showing a few more examples if wish to see it in action:

[https://youtu.be/g1Sb4G-fITc](https://youtu.be/g1Sb4G-fITc)

  
The tool is open source so if you feel brave enough, or want to contribute to the codebase here's the link to the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/cryptocurrency-gpt](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/cryptocurrency-gpt)

It's built using Astro.js and Typescript. The GitHub should contain all the info on how to run it locally, but I also covered it in more detail here: [https://medium.com/coinmonks/i-made-an-ai-trading-assistant-for-your-crypto-portfolio-ad59cfc000fc?sk=cda82e7ed375fe85f8c9eaac18042270](https://medium.com/coinmonks/i-made-an-ai-trading-assistant-for-your-crypto-portfolio-ad59cfc000fc?sk=cda82e7ed375fe85f8c9eaac18042270)

  
Obvious disclaimer - It's an experimental tool I built because I like the idea of using natural language to manage my portfolio, but I wouldn't recommend connect it to your main exchange account - unless you're also in r/WSB \- in that case go ham.

What would be the pros and cons of selling covered calls against the shares?

If the price goes down, great! I get the premium and maintain my shares. As a longterm holder I'm fine with the temporary price drop.

If the price goes up, worst case is they exercise and my shares get called away, but I benefit from the premium received and I can repurchase however much of exposure I want to end up with, right? I guess the tax liability of the full tranche of shares getting assigned is a con. There's the obvious con of limiting upside, but that would be limited if I sold anyway. Maybe it's more of a con if the amount of underlying shares is greater than the number of shares I'd want to sell to take profits since all 100 shares are limited upside versus just 20 shares being sold outright.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hea3ht/is_selling_covered_calls_a_good_way_to_take/,2024-12-14 11:15:16,bought_high_sold_low,8,CryptoCurrency,0.54,0.16568986568986568

It takes radio communications approx 20 minutes to go from Earth to Mars

It takes light communications approx 3 minutes to go from Earth to Mars

How would blockchains handle this delay, if you have nodes running on both planets and you want to send Crypto from Earth to Mars. Could you in theory have your wallet sync'd on both Martian and Earth nodes, and spend them twice before the system catches on? BTC has average confirmation of 10 minutes, but other cryptos have confirmation times that are less than 3 minutes.

Or should Mars have its own Crypto? Or have two separate nodes, when you go to Mars, it takes it out of your earth node, similar to the wrappedBTC or that stuff, beams it to Mars, gets accepted there, removed from Earth node, and it'll be waiting for you once you get there in 9 mos?

","Top 10 Crypto Predictions for 2025 from VanEck:

1.Crypto bull market hits a medium-term peak in Q1, sets new highs in Q4

* We believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle’s apex, we project Bitcoin (BTC) to be valued at around **$180,000**, with Ethereum (ETH) trading above **$6,000**. Other prominent projects, such as Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could exceed **$500** and **$10,** respectively.
* Following this first peak, we anticipate a **30%** retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing sharper declines of up to **60%** as the market consolidates during the summer. However, a recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year

2.U.S. embraces bitcoin with strategic reserve(s) and increased crypto adoption

3.Value of tokenized securities exceeds $50 billion

4.Stablecoins daily settlement volumes reach $300 billion

5. AI agents’ onchain activity surpasses 1 million agents

* One of the most compelling narratives we believe will translate into massive traction in 2025 is AI Agents.

6. Bitcoin layer-2s reach 100,000 BTC in total value locked (TVL)

7. Ethereum blob space generates $1 billion in fees

8. DeFi hits all-time highs with $4 trillion DEX volumes and $200B TVL

9. NFT market recovery with trading volumes reaching $30 billion

10. DApp tokens narrow the performance gap with L1 tokens

35,1hcvxi5,Finding strong alts,"During alt season, everyone's a winner, but there's a big difference between catching a 10x-20x and a 2x-3x. So how do you know beforehand which alts are strongest? Which alts are fueled by the narrative or have the most momentum?

This past week's market structure is an excellent opportunity to find them. At the beginning of the week, BTC dipped and the alt market overreacted, like it always does. But once BTC recovered, how did alts behave? The strong alts have already recovered and are up on the week, as if the dip never happened. Outperformers tend to continue to outperform. Scroll down coingecko and research every coin in the top 100 that is:

1. Green on the weekly.
2. Not a restaked/wrapped BTC/ETH.
3. Not a meme. Memes generally don't follow the rules IMO. I don't understand them and don't invest. Not sure how well this rule applies to them, maybe it does. Invest at your own risk.

Research every one. If you are holding a coin, and the coin you are holding is still down on the weekly, but a competitor is up? Consider moving some money over. The best tech doesn't win in alt season, narratives do. Notice a narrative that is trending (e.g. RWA), consider allocating a portion of your portfolio if you haven't already.

Bonus points: look for common narratives between coins that are up this week, e.g. gaming, AI, RWA, L2s, etc.

Considering the volatility of the space, an alternate view of your portfolio especially if you are stocking up on alts should be considered.

If you are using **Coingecko**, on your top-right side of the page, you can toggle the 'Currency' and view your portfolio in BTC or ETH.

[Figure 2: Coingecko's Currency Toggle to BTC](https://preview.redd.it/6shdn939lb6e1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=510ec0a6bb6be68e8b9878df973f142271584644)

As we can see here, the 'volatility' is a bit more apparent when it is viewed in USD (Figure 5). However, when viewed through both BTC and ETH perspective (Figure 3 and Figure 4), the market was in somewhat of a different view. Although I am literally taking 5 items for this example, the key here is to understand how well the coins are performing in context of the crypto space. **This could give you an idea how that alt coin have been performing, and time your DCA from alt to BTC, ETH, or other cryptos.**

The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE, DOT.**

November highlights for the 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **XRP** and **ADA** have a very, very good month
* All cryptos in the positive territory YTD. **DOGE** rockets into first place overall, **XRP** is second, **BTC** in third. **AVAX** in last place  
* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio** is up +100% in one month, +110% in 2024.

# November Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks eleven months into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/3thsg8cww76e1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=36233f901c12211a3a4d3a1d3f364493f49643cb

For such a busy year in crypto, not a ton of movement in the Top Ten in 2024.

# November Winners and Losers

***November Winners*** – **XRP** (+319%) outperformed its peers by far this month followed by **ADA** (+222%) and **DOGE** (+172%)

***November Losers*** – Although up +13%, **BNB** gained the least this month.

# Overall Update: DOGE flips BNB for first place.  100% of cryptos in positive territory.  AVAX in last place.

What a difference a month makes: 100% of the Top Ten are in positive territory now, up from just [60% in the green in October.](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10)

Over the last few months, **DOGE** (+375% YTD) has been on a tear, moving from third to first since September.  **XRP**’s strong November landed it in second place (+241%) followed distantly third place **BTC** (+117%).

Eleven months into the 2024 Experiment **AVAX** is now in last place, up +6% since New Year’s Day.

The initial $100 invested in first place **DOGE** eleven months ago is worth $475 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024

https://preview.redd.it/1ho0yboxw76e1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a2fd12cbcc9810baf34bd65a711d004d4d572fe

The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio gained $987 in November.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$2,100**, an All Time High for the Portfolio. 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/39no93syw76e1.png?width=214&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcc21b9550edf8af30dfd9dda2e3c2e9c4f05aec

# 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 7 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eleven months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot: 

https://preview.redd.it/59ks6if0x76e1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77732246c255b4b3925223c7afe33b8182d80ba

**November Performances:**

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: +89% 
* **AMKT**: +34%

The November monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

**Overall since January 1st, 2024:** 

* **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+110%
*  **AMKT:** \+88%

Overall lead: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

A very interesting month for indexooors.  Experiment followers may notice that this is the first month in two years that the **Top Ten Portfolio** has taken the overall lead from **AMKT** and the first month the Top Ten has held both the monthly and the overall victory columns. 

This is undoubtedly because of the outsized gainz of both **ADA** and **XRP** in November which are each purchased at an even distribution model (10% each) in my Experiment vs. the market cap weighted approach of **AMKT**.  As much as I’d like to flex, I predict my outperformance will be short lived, given the data from the last two years and the fact that **AMKT** is coming up on its quarterly rebalancing soon.

For the more visual, here’s the table I’m using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/r2z6w362x76e1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=0de3c67df1c4c31115faf8cc387e2b1681d259ff

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +79% (total value $1,789)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +756% (total value $8,559)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +999% (total value $10,994) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +369% (total value $4,694)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -1% (total value $991) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +248% (total value $3,483)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11): up +110% (total value $2,100)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$32,611**

**That’s up +366%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Special shout out to the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio, which is tantalizingly close to break even point for the first time since its inception in January of 2022.

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/wiazfe93x76e1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f358e22ca6aade166a8c72d671d7361149c021

In summary: ***That’s a +366% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/6rn1l284x76e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dd2b7d65fa6cf1b1eb56ab023810427143228a

The S&P 500 is up +27% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,268 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,262 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,413 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,872 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,610 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,269 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,575 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,268 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $12,269.**

That is up **+75%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+366%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

48,1hbhsgx,Not a single top 100 Alt from 2021/2022 has hit a new ATH against BTC. ,"An Alt to BTC pair tells how a crypto asset is performing against BTC over a period of time. Perhaps the most famous alt to btc pair is ETH to BTC and although ETH is up in USD it has never hit a new ATH against BTC.

https://preview.redd.it/eyhhd1wf946e1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc377c08596648b802ac69b4ef20f8684f55c87

In fact if you purchased ETH during the ETH to BTC ATH on June 11th 2017 you'd be up \~11X in USD on your investment. But had you bought BTC instead you'd be up over 33x...

https://preview.redd.it/gh4hhi9y946e1.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ceff32260d5b66321b634b363200a89a90a28a1

The fact is almost every single alt will be outperformed by BTC over time and although a few alts may break that trend especially in the short term. Holding alts through multiple cycles is risky at best and foolish at worst.

If we look at the top 100 Alts from 2021, not a single alt from the top 100 in 2021 has managed to break it's 2021 or 2022 ATH against BTC.

[https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20211123023737\/https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en](https://preview.redd.it/x4to82txa46e1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2620245e886d4244b02ed05238bdf2760246efa)

Now you're probably thinking one of the following. So I'll preemptively address them.

* ""Alt season is just getting started this isn't a fair comparison""
* ""Ya But I'm up in USD on my investment""
* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""
* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""
* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""
* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""
* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""

So let's break these down one by one.

**\* ""Alt Season is just getting started""**

BTC Dominance has definitely fallen but if you're gambling on future gains you have to first accept it's a gamble, and the current break down could be the farthest that it goes. If you have gains it's not a bad thing to realize gains.

**\* ""Ya but I'm up in USD on my investment""**

If that's you, you either purchased a long time ago in a bear market and held through a bull market, and a bear market - and you would most likely be up even more if you just purchased BTC. Alternatively you are a new purchaser and you got some nice gains on the breakdown of BTC dominance.

If you held your ALT from 2021 to today you are guaranteed to be down significantly compared to just holding BTC.

**\* ""I don't want to trade because taxes are complicated""**

Ya Taxes are complicated but that only matters if you're in profit. If you hold your alt to the top and back down because ""you're a long term holder"", you are simply making bad investment decisions.

**\* ""It's safer to hold and your grandchildren will thank you""**

Please STOP with this nonsense, Long term nearly every Crypto asset will not only bleed value against BTC but also bleed value in USD. Don't believe me check the top 100 crypto assets in 2017, 2021, and 2024 and count how many assets from 2017 are still in the top 100 today.

**\* ""Stop trying to get people to sell""**

I'm not trying to get people to sell, I'm trying to get people to stop with the the nonsense where they demonize selling. You can hold your alt of your choice just don't reinforce the mindless selling alts is bad philosophy.

**\* ""I'm not a trader I make a plan and stick to it""**

It's always good to stick to a plan in investments and to think rationally but if your plan is to hold your alt for the next ten years, just buy BTC instead.

**\* ""You're a trashy BTC Maxi""**

I'm not a BTC Maxi I wouldn't have 98% of my crypto investments in rCC Moons if I was a BTC maxi.

First off, apologies if this is a dumb question or if someone else has already asked or if I’m missing key elements that make the question completely redundant. I’m pretty fresh to this whole thing.

With Trump et al. proclaiming they will be strategically “stock piling” anywhere up to 4 million BTC (quote RFK Jr), I’ve been seeing a lot of stories about how the US government have acquired a lot of their current stock pile.

Apparently a large portion (if not all) of BTC the US own has been acquired through seizure from crime, think shutting down Silk Road for example.

My buddy told me to buy xrp when it was under a dollar and he had a shit load of shares I didn’t believe in that.

And most recently I missed out on btc shooting to 100k after the election because I guess I just wasn’t paying attention or didn’t have enough common sense to understand that would happen.

Well I believe that on 1/20 crypto will shoot up again and this time I don’t want to miss out. I was thinking of spending a few hundred bucks on cardano, maybe chill guy, and another coin maybe solana or another smaller coin.

Premise, I am trying to be level headed in this crazy moment for crypto, my portfolio is up 150% and I am pondering my next move.

1. I read a lot about an imminent bull run, why is people so confident? Regardless of your political stance, Trump and Elon are coming in January and this is a good thing for the market. But is this enough?
2. since the last month BTC is slowly growing and putting in sliglthy better highs in what seems an upwards directed accumulation phase, why are altcoins stagnating? Shouldn't this be their dream scenario?
3. something psychological, what is happening right now? People seems to have high expectations but BTC grows slowly and altcoins might be even bleeding, if someone was certain of a bullrun altcoins should be a no brainer rn since even the most famous of them didn't even reach their ATH yet.

63,1hfajno,Trump’s Fake Pro-Crypto Stance Is Seriously Pissing Me Off,"
As a lifelong Trump supporter, I’ve stuck with him through almost everything. But his recent flip-flopping on crypto is making me furious. Back in 2022, when Bitcoin was crashing, I really wanted to gamble some money on it—just buy 1 BTC at the lows, set a sell limit, and forget about it. I even have texts with my brother from back then where I was seriously considering it.  

But no, I didn’t do it. Why? Because Trump called it a scam. And I trusted him. I ended up going with stock-picking instead, and put my money into EV stocks like Rivian and Lucid. Guess what? Those tanked hard and probably won’t recover anytime soon. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has quietly recovered, and anyone who bought at $69k is sitting on profits.  

What gets me the most is how Trump suddenly changed his mind on crypto without any explanation. There’s one thing about evolving your views, but to not even explain why you did a 180? That’s just fake. And now here I am, unemployed and struggling to get by, knowing that if I had just ignored him and bought that Bitcoin, it would’ve made up for pretty much all my losses from 2021.  

I’m not even mad about the crypto itself—I still think it’s all fake pumps and hype. But the point is, I missed out on the gamble because I trusted Trump’s judgment back then. He let me down on this one, and it’s hard not to feel bitter about it. And now it just looks like he's a con man",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hfajno/trumps_fake_procrypto_stance_is_seriously_pissing/,2024-12-15 19:53:47,Muslim_conservative,16,CryptoMarkets,0.25,-0.09195906432748539

74,1hdgeqp,I had a theory about alt seasons changing and,"… aaand well here’s chatgpt’s wonderful prompted argument for it:  


Your argument about Bitcoin dominance remaining relatively higher due to increased participation by institutional and whale investors is both plausible and noteworthy. Here’s a breakdown of its playability and plausibility, and how it may alter predictions regarding an altcoin season:

Plausibility of the Argument
	1.	Institutional Investors’ Focus on Bitcoin:
	•	Truthful and Evident: Institutional investors (e.g., BlackRock, Grayscale) have largely focused on Bitcoin due to its status as a “digital gold,” regulatory acceptance, and liquidity.
	•	Example: Bitcoin ETFs (spot and futures) are gaining traction, which primarily benefits BTC rather than altcoins.
	2.	Bitcoin Dominance Trends:
	•	Historical Context: Previous alt seasons (e.g., 2017 and 2021) saw Bitcoin dominance dip below 40%, as retail investors diversified into altcoins.
	•	Current Dynamics: Recent altcoin rallies (e.g., Chainlink, Avalanche) have occurred without a sharp drop in Bitcoin dominance, which remains above 50%.
	•	Implication: It’s reasonable to expect Bitcoin dominance to stay relatively high even during an altcoin season.
	3.	Whale Behavior:
	•	Large holders often treat BTC as a safer store of value, avoiding riskier altcoins unless those altcoins exhibit clear, scalable use cases (e.g., ETH for DeFi or ARB for Layer 2 scaling).

Playability of the Argument

Your argument shifts the framework for identifying an alt season:
	•	New Metrics Required: Instead of relying solely on a sharp drop in Bitcoin dominance, alt seasons may now be driven by:
	•	Sector-Specific Growth: Focus on DeFi, Layer 2 solutions, or AI-related altcoins.
	•	Rotational Liquidity: Investors moving from Bitcoin to promising altcoins without BTC dominance falling below 50%.
	•	Revised Expectations: The traditional idea of alt season with BTC dominance below 40% may no longer hold, as institutional interest keeps Bitcoin as a significant market anchor.

Does This Change the Prediction?

Yes, the argument influences the interpretation of market conditions and timing of an alt season:
	1.	Alt Season Likelihood:
	•	An alt season is still plausible but may look different:
	•	Focused on Quality Projects: Altcoins with strong fundamentals, utility, and tokenomics (e.g., ETH, LINK, DOT) will outperform weaker, speculative coins.
	•	Sector-Led Growth: Specific sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, AI, or Layer 2 solutions) may lead rather than the broader market.
	•	Bitcoin dominance may not drop significantly but could stabilize between 50-55%.
	2.	Market Strategy Shift:
	•	Investors should focus on altcoins with real-world use cases, high developer activity, and scalability rather than speculative or meme-based tokens.
	•	Projects like ETH (DeFi leader), ARB (Layer 2 scaling), and DOT (interoperability) are more likely to drive gains.
	3.	Timeline Shift:
	•	Altcoin growth may happen in shorter, sector-specific waves rather than a single, broad alt season. For example:
	•	A Layer 2 boom followed by a DeFi boom.
	•	Stronger performance from higher-cap altcoins rather than smaller speculative projects.

Conclusion

Your argument is both plausible and insightful. It redefines how we interpret alt seasons in the current market dynamic. Instead of focusing on sharp drops in Bitcoin dominance, future alt seasons will likely be:
	•	Sector-driven and selective rather than broad and retail-fueled.
	•	Dominated by fundamental utility altcoins over speculative plays.

Revised Prediction: The next alt season is likely to focus on strong projects within specific sectors rather than the entire altcoin market, with Bitcoin dominance remaining relatively stable above 50%. This shift requires a more nuanced investment strategy, emphasizing quality over quantity.

85,1hbfa2x,Seeking Feedback: Switching Between Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Based on Market Cycles—Is It Worth It?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been reflecting on my crypto investment strategy and wanted to share it here for discussion. My approach is relatively simple:

* For most of the market cycle, I stick to **Bitcoin (BTC)** due to its stability, dominance, and long-term value as a store of wealth.
* During the speculative peaks of bull markets, I consider allocating to other assets, primarily **Ethereum (ETH)** (which I personally view as the ""second-best"" crypto asset) and occasionally select altcoins, aiming to capitalize on their typically higher returns during these periods.

# Key Questions I’m Exploring:

1. **Long-Term Effectiveness**: Is this strategy effective over multiple cycles? While it sounds logical, I want to understand its performance when tested against historical data. Have others here tried a similar approach?
2. **Alternative Strategies**: Are there alternative approaches that have proven to be more reliable? For instance, would a diversified portfolio of BTC + ETH throughout the cycle outperform my timing-based approach?
3. **Timing the Market**: For those who favor switching between assets, what metrics or indicators have you found helpful? Examples could include Bitcoin dominance, ETH/BTC ratios, or broader macro trends.

I recognize the inherent challenges in timing the market, and I’m eager to hear differing perspectives. Some of you may advocate for a more passive allocation strategy, and I’m open to learning why that might be better over the long term.

# Why I’m Asking:

I’m really committed to making informed, data-driven decisions in crypto investing. I want to move beyond intuition or hype and understand what works best in the long run. I value the insights of this community and would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and critiques of this approach.
