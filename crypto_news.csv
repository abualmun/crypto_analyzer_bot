Interestingly the memecoin market cap surpassed $140 billion. Investors who were eyeing memecoins are in hot waters with a recent controversy over their licensing rights. The story revolves around, the iconic Doge meme, born from the Shiba Inu dog Kabosu, which continues to leave its mark on the crypto world. After Kabosu passed away, her owner, Atsuko Sato, adopted a new Shiba Inu named Neiro, which quickly became a symbol in the meme coin space. Following the news many Neiro-themed coins started flooding the market each claiming the identity of the original coin. Amid this IP mania, the Own the Doge DAO, a collective focused on preserving the legacy of the Doge meme, secured the official intellectual property (IP) rights for Neiro directly from @kabosumama. This move has put the DAO in a unique position to decide which Neiro token should be recognized as the “official” one, bringing clarity to all the Neiro-themed coins. This will help the community to stay safe from scams and fraud. We’re pleased to announce that @kabosumama has officially granted our DAO the Neiro IP. When Atsuko revealed the name of her new adopted dog, Neiro, many tokens were launched in an attempt to capitalize on her name and story. However, since then, these various tokens have… pic.twitter.com/HCAL0ghCNS — Own The Doge (@ownthedoge) December 16, 2024 To ensure a fair and decentralized decision-making process, the DAO will allow DOG token holders to vote on which token deserves the official title. Sato retains veto power, ensuring that the final decision aligns with her vision for Neiro’s legacy and the integrity of the Doge community. The entire community cheered this move. The love myself and the community for Neiro is unconditional, and uncomplicated. Our biggest mission is to make sure Neiro follows the footsteps of Doge, with the fun and fairness for all, we meme everyday, we protect everyday, and most off all, we do whatever it takes to keep… pic.twitter.com/aKVCFr3Sz9 — CryptoLogic (@Lebologic) December 17, 2024 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, ETH, & XRP Price Prediction For This Week: What’s Next As BTC Price Hits $106k? , Crypto Impact The stakes are high in this decision. One of the Neiro tokens, based on Ethereum, boasts a market cap of $663 million, while others, such as the Solana-based token, are valued at around $5 million. The outcome of this vote could dramatically reshape the landscape of Neiro-inspired meme coins, potentially elevating one token to dominance or rejecting all contenders. Recently the creator of Peanut the Squirrel , Mark Longo, sent a letter to Binance , accusing them of using his trademark without permission. Sparking debates over all memecoins legitimacy and legal rights. Since like altcoins, people are investing hugely in memecoins and such news can break this bullish momentum. We need to wait and watch what shape this digital dog war takes in the future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37800804,https://coingape.com/?p=229924,2024-12-18 05:52:01,Circle CEO Gives Take On Stablecoin Legislation And Bitcoin Future,https://coingape.com/circle-ceo-gives-take-on-stablecoin-legislation-and-bitcoin-future/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO and co-founder, recently discussed stablecoin legislation and Bitcoin’s role within the global financial sector. Allaire, a long-time voice in the crypto space, said constructive regulation should continue to help the growth and innovation of the digital asset market. While he thinks that Bitcoin’s fixed supply could position it as a potential reserve asset, when it comes to stablecoins Allaire opines that, with federal law, stablecoins could become true digital cash. Circle CEO: Federal Stablecoin Legislation Key to Mainstream Crypto Adoption In a recent interview , Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO, shared his thoughts on the volatile outlook for cryptocurrency regulation and what it holds for Bitcoin. The central theme of his discussion was that clear federal legislation needs to be passed around stablecoins if the mainstream is to widely adopt digital assets. While he believes Bitcoin’s fixed supply could make it a viable reserve asset, he argues that federal legislation could enable stablecoins to function as true digital cash. Speaking about the US crypto policy under the new administration, Allaire recognized a big shift and stated: “ We’ve gone from an administration that was often hostile to crypto to one with broad bipartisan support for constructive laws and rulemaking.” He also emphasized clear definitions of digital assets in legislation to allow a more strong and regulated marketplace for cryptocurrencies. When talking about stablecoins, Circle CEO emphasized the lack of federal legislation that would classify dollar-backed stablecoins as legitimate electronic money within the US financial system. According to him, such a regulatory framework would be one in which stablecoins would finally achieve mainstream adoption. He added: “Every company, financial institution, and public corporation worldwide could treat stablecoins as digital cash, dramatically expanding their use.” Circle recently partnered with Binance and the partnership comes as an endeavor by the firms to expand the adoption of the USDC stablecoin while also jacking up the global digital-asset financial services ecosystem. Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset? Allaire Discusses Its Long-Term Value Turning to Bitcoin, Allaire mentioned the role of Bitcoin as a reserve asset so much reiterated by Donald Trump. Allaire also spoke about what that would mean for US fiscal policy. He spoke about discussions that have been going on around the strategic reserve of Bitcoin, like Texas trying to make its own and the constitutional issues with states managing their own currencies. However, he reiterated the broader significance of sound money principles. Circle CEO said: “We need full-reserve digital dollars, like stablecoins, to be a mass export product of the United States.” He also added that what the US needs is to make sure the dollar stays the internet’s leading currency while advancing the principles of sound money. Allaire went on to discuss the long-term value proposition for Bitcoin , pointing to the fixed supply and potential of the asset to serve as digital gold. While he was hesitant to provide a terminal value for Bitcoin, he suggested its market cap could grow significantly if fiat currencies integrate digital gold-like instruments into their reserves. He concluded by emphasizing the need for clarity in regulation and innovation-friendly policy. “The world needs to operate on sound money principles,” Circle CEO said, further advocating for a financial system that balances innovation with stability. As stablecoins and Bitcoin continue to shape the future of finance, Allaire’s insights underscore the importance of thoughtful regulation to harness their full potential.

On Dec. 17, Coinbase responded to a lawsuit filed by Sun-affiliated BiT Global, which accused the exchange of harming the WBTC market by removing the token in November. In its filing, Coinbase cited risks tied to Sun, including allegations of financial misconduct and ongoing regulatory investigations. “Guilt by Association” The filing sparked backlash within the crypto community, with many arguing Coinbase failed to provide sufficient legal or technical justification for the delisting. Critics also pointed out that Coinbase itself has been under several regulatory investigations. Bitcoin enthusiast and Coinbase skeptic Pledditor took to X on Dec. 17, accusing the exchange of making a decision based solely on personal bias. “It’s basically just they don’t like Justin Sun,” Pledditor stated, calling it “guilt by association.” The filing referenced Sun’s alleged misconduct, claiming he has “reportedly violated industry and government standards intended to prevent fraud.” Coinbase expressed skepticism over BiT Global’s reliability, citing its association with Sun. “So too is any acknowledgment that he has repeatedly been accused of, investigated for, and sued for financial misconduct, and that reports of his alleged misdeeds abound in the press and crypto community more broadly,” the filing stated. Sun’s Regulatory Troubles Justin Sun, founder of the Tron cryptocurrency, has faced numerous legal challenges. In March 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him with fraud and securities violations. He has also reportedly been investigated by the FBI and the Southern District of New York’s prosecutor’s office. Irony Noted by Critics Prominent figures like VanEck adviser Gabor Gurbacs pointed out the irony of Coinbase’s actions, given its own legal troubles. “It’s ironic that Coinbase is treating Justin Tron this way. Coinbase itself is under SEC and numerous other investigations, probably many more than Justin and his businesses,” Gurbacs said in an X post shared by Sun.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,EN,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/feed/,0,0,NEGATIVE,2024-12-18 05:53:14,

According to a Bloomberg report published on Dec. 18, German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG is in the process of building a “so-called” Layer 2 for a public network. The lender hopes the project will clear regulatory challenges faced by financial firms trying to incorporate public blockchains into their operations. Last month Deutsche Bank released a test version of Project Dama 2, which includes a Layer 2 that is built on the Ethereum ( ETH ) network, the second-largest cryptocurrency network by market capitalization after Bitcoin ( BTC ). Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, Boon-Hiong Chan said that public blockchains like Ethereum pose a risk for financial institutions entering the blockchain, as firms harbor worries of interacting with criminals or sanctioned entities within the ecosystem. This is because, according to Chan, institutions do not know “who exactly is validating the transactions” and whether transaction fees could fall into the pockets of sanctioned entities. There is also the looming threat of facing a “hard fork” in the ecosystem that could radically change the digital ledger. “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied,” said Chan to Bloomberg, adding the bank is still waiting on regulatory approval but it hopes to launch the product as a minimum viable by next year.

In addition, he stated that regulators could be given “super admin rights” that lets them monitor the movement of funds within the blockchain to spot illicit transactions. “You are not dependent on the Layer 1 for detailed transaction records anymore,” said Chan. Project Dama 2 is part of an even larger initiative formed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore called Project Guardian. Project Guardian brings together 24 leading financial firms that are exploring ways to utilize the blockchain to tokenize assets. Though, the project has raised questions on just how deep banks are willing to venture when it comes to the crypto sphere. The Dama 2 in particular was born from collaborations with crypto firms Memento Blockchain and Interop Labs. The platform was built using ZKsync technology. As early as May 2024, Deutsche Bank announced it was in the process of testing an unnamed Ethereum-based platform. The bank said the platform would offer services centered around tokenized funds. Deutsche Bank joined Project Guardian on May 14, aiming to test the feasibility of asset tokenization alongside other major banking firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., DBS Group, and Ant International among others.
